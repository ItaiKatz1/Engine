Greetings respected user, and welcome to our engine!
In the User Interface you'll find two sections:
1. The upper section will allow you to create your own inverted index using a corpus of your choosing.
2. The bottom section will allow you to insert a single query or a queries file and retrieve the top 50
   documents relevant for the single query, or 50 documents for each of the queries. Once you've retrieved 
   the results for your query/queries, you can select the bottom choose-box to retrieve the top 5 entities
   in a specific document to your choosing.

In addition to the main sections, there are additonal features that you can use:
1. "Stemming" will allow you to stem both the inverted indexer you create and the queries you insert.
2. "Display Dictionary" will allow you to see your dictionary on the main screen.
3. "Load Dictionary" will write the dictionary you created to the secondary memory.
4. "Reset" will delete from the secondary memory the inverted indexer you created.
5. "Save results", along with choosing a specific location, will save the results retrieved from your query's search
    in a format that will be usable with the "TREC-EVAL" application.
6. "Semantic" will allow you to also search for results that match words that have the same semantic meaning as your 
    original query.

We hope you enjoy using our engine and we'd like you wish you happy retrival!
